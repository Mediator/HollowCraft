Compiling
=========
Tools Required:
ant
java

Libraries Required:
xstream
mina-core
slf4j
jython


By default, the build.xml file looks for those libraries in /usr/share/java/. To
change the search locations, edit the respective properties in build.xml

To compile the server, run ``ant build''. This compiles it all to bin/.

Running
=======
There are different methods of running the server. The easiest is to type
``ant run''. This goes through the stages of compilation and finally results in
the hollowcraft-server-<release>.jar file being built to dist/, which then gets
ran. If you want to run hollowcraft-server.jar by itself, you'll need to pass the
class path of all the libraries needed, and it assumes you've got a proper data/
directory.

hollowcraft.jar contains a bootstrap.zip file, which contains a pre-built data/
directory. If you'd prefer to use your system libraries for running HollowCraft,
you'll want this one.

hollowcraft-full.jar contains all the libraries you need along with bootstrap.zip.
If you're having trouble getting the libraries together or the term 'classpath'
is pretty foreign to you, you'll want that one. Just run it with ``java -jar
/path/to/opencraft-full.jar''. It'll Just Work like magic.
