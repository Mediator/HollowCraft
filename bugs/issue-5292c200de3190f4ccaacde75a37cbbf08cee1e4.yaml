title: Old .mine/.dat file loading
desc: |-
  Since the WoM client still dumps .dat files and the official client saves .mine files, we should
  be able to load up that file type into the server, even if we don't save back to it.

    Minecraft's licensing and java's serialization API prevents us from doing this.
    If java provided a way to create a ObjectStreamClass from scratch, or set a custom name, we'd be set.
    
    Unless someone wants to actually write their own implementation of the serialization API *just* for this task.
