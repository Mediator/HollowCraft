title: Personal Level Spawn Points
desc: |-
  With the official minecraft project supporting infdev (infinite development), it would be nice if a person could set their own spawn point
  that they spawn at when connecting. If someone builds a house a mile away from the main spawn point, then they should not have to walk that
  entire mile again.
