  - The point of registering a command with a gamemode is to restrict what commands are available to a certain gamemode. If survival doesn't register a cuboid command, cuboid cannot be called at all because it won't exist in that game mode.

  - changed status from unstarted to in_progress
  - I am going to make the commands are smarter objects. I don't feel that the commands should exist completely separate from the GameMode because it is a good way to limit the available commands. That should be a separate task.
