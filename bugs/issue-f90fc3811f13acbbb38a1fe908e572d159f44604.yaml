title: Spaztic Water
desc: When there is a space that is 2 blocks wide and C blocks long, and there is only enough water to fill 2 * C - 1 blocks, the air bubble dances about indefinately. Also when a block is placed near or on that air block, strange things happen like extremely delayed block placement.
